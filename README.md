[00:00.79] Ooh, hey-hey, aw
[00:05.08] What we're livin' in?
[00:07.12] Let me tell ya
[00:14.12] 
[00:08.83] And it's a wonder men can eat at all
[00:11.72] When things are big that should be small
[00:14.41] Who can tell what magic spells we'll be doin' for us?
[00:18.90] And I'm givin' all my love to this world
[00:22.61] Only to be told
[00:24.43] I can't see, I can't breathe
[00:27.37] No more will we be
[00:36.37] 
[00:29.96] And nothin's gonna change the way we live
[00:32.33] 'Cause we can always take, but never give
[00:35.03] And now that things are changing for the worse, see
[00:38.49] Whoa, it's a crazy world we're livin' in
[00:41.90] And I just can't see that half of us immersed in sin
[00:45.90] Is all we have to give these
[00:59.90] 
[00:48.44] Futures made of virtual insanity, now
[00:53.66] Always seem to be governed by this love we have
[00:58.36] For useless twisting of our new technology
[01:03.60] Oh, now there is no sound
[01:06.02] For we all live underground
[01:19.52] 
[01:08.58] And I'm thinkin' what a mess we're in
[01:12.08] Hard to know where to begin
[01:14.57] If I could slip the sickly ties that earthly man has made
[01:19.24] And now every mother can choose the colour
[01:24.53] Of her child, that's not nature's way
[01:43.03] 
[01:28.65] Well, that's what they said yesterday
[01:31.57] There's nothin' left to do but pray
[01:33.86] I think it's time I found a new religion
[01:37.29] Whoa, it's so insane to synthesize another strain
[01:41.59] There's something in these futures that we have to be told
[02:10.59] 
[01:45.73] Futures made of virtual insanity, now
[01:51.36] Always seem to be governed by this love we have
[01:56.10] For useless twisting of our new technology
[02:00.98] Oh, now there is no sound
[02:03.58] For we all live underground, whoa
[02:20.08] 
[02:06.61] Now there is no sound
[02:09.57] If we all live underground
[02:12.30] And now it's virtual insanity
[02:14.75] Forget your virtual reality
[02:17.25] Oh, there's nothin' so bad
[02:20.85] As a man-made man
[02:23.38] Oh yeah, I know, yeah (take it to the dance floor)
[02:48.38] 
[02:26.48] Ooh, I know I can't go on
[02:38.98] 
[02:27.25] Ooh, of this virtual insanity we're living in
[02:28.07] Has got to change, yeah
[02:28.48] Things will never be the same
[02:29.08] And I can't go on while we're living in, oh
[02:29.74] Oh, virtual insanity
[02:39.74] 
[02:30.23] Oh, this world has got to change
[02:30.99] 'Cause I just, I just can't keep going on
[02:31.47] In this virtual, virtual insanity
[02:31.82] That we're livin' in, that we're livin' in
[02:33.07] And a virtual insanity is what it is
[02:33.72] Yeah, ooh
[02:38.22] 
[02:45.96] Futures made of virtual insanity, now
[02:51.00] Always seem to be governed by this love we have
[02:55.88] For useless twisting of our new technology
[03:00.84] Oh, now there is no sound
[03:03.56] For we all live underground
[03:17.06] 
[03:04.96] Oh, futures made of, now, virtual insanity
[03:05.51] Now we all, we seem to be governed by a love
[03:06.29] For these useless twisting of our new technology
[03:06.53] And now there is no sound, for we all live underground
[03:06.93] Yes, we do, oh
[03:13.93] 
[03:07.38] (Livin' in) now, this life that we live in
[03:10.02] (Virtual insanity) it's all goin' wrong
[03:12.14] Out of the window (livin' in), you know
[03:15.15] (Virtual insanity) that there is nothing worse than
[03:18.44] (Livin' in) a man-made man
[03:21.59] (Virtual insanity) there is nothing worse than
[03:24.10] (Livin' in) a foolish man (virtual insanity), hey!
[03:30.30] Virtual insanity is what we're livin' in, yeah, yeah
[03:40.66] Well, it's alright
