Ooh, hey-hey, oh
What we're living in
Lemme tell ya

It is a wonder men can eat at all
When things are big that should be small
Who can tell what magic spells we'll be doing for us
And I'm giving all my love to this world

Only to be told
I can't see, I can't breathe
No more will we be
And nothing's gonna change the way we live
'Cause we can always take but never give

And now that things are changing for the worse, see
Woah, it's a crazy world we're living in
And I just can't see that half of us immersed in sin
Is all we have to give this

Future's made of virtual insanity, now
Always seem to be governed by this love we have
For useless, twisting, other new technology
Oh, now there is no sound
For we all live underground

And I'm thinking what a mess we're in
Hard to know where to begin
If I could slip the sickly ties that earthly man has made
And now every mother, can choose the color
Of her child
That's not nature's way

Well, that's what they said yesterday
There's nothing left to do but pray
I think it's time I found a new religion
Woah, it's so insane
To synthesize another strain
There's something in these futures
That we have to be told

Future's made of virtual insanity, now
Always seem to be governed by this love we have
For useless, twisting, other new technology
Oh, now there is no sound
For we all live underground, woah

Now there is no sound
If we all live underground
And now it's virtual insanity
Forget your virtual reality
Oh, there's nothing so bad
As a meddling man

Ooh, yeah
I know, yeah
Take it to the dance floor

Oh, I know I can't go on
Oh, of this virtual insanity we're living in
Has got to change, yeah
Things will never be the same
And I can't go on

While we're living in
Oh, oh virtual insanity
Ohh, this world has got to change
'Cause I just
I just can't keep going on in this virtual, virtual insanity
That we're living in, that we're living in
And that virtual insanity is what it is, yeah, oh

Future's made of virtual insanity, now
Always seem to be governed by this love we have
For useless, twisting, other new technology
Oh, now there is no sound
For we all live underground, oh

Futures made of, now, virtual insanity
Now we all, we seem to be governed by a love
For these useless, twisting, other new technology
And now there is no sound, for we all live underground

Yes we do, oh
(Living in) now, this life that we live in
(Virtual insanity) it's all going wrong
Gone out the window, you know (living in)
There is nothing worse than (virtual insanity)

(Living in) a meddling man
(Virtual insanity) there is nothing worse than
(Living in) a foolish man, ha (virtual insanity)
Virtual insanity is what we're living in, yeah-yeah
Well, it's alright now
