Oh yeah,
What we're living in
(let me tell ya)
It's a wonder
Man can eat at all
When things are big
That should be small
Who can tell what magic spells
we'll be doing for us．
And I'm giving all my love
to this world
Only to be told
I can't see
I can' t breathe
No more will we be
And nothing's going to
change the way we live
Cos' we can always take
but never give
And now that things are changing
for the worse,
See,it's a crazy world
we're living in
And I just can see that half of
us immersed in sin
Is all we have to give these
Futures made of virtual insanity
now always seem to,
be govern'd by this love we have
For useless,twisting,
our new technology
oh, now there is no sound
for we all live underground
And I'm thinking
what a mess we're in
hard to know where to begin
If I could slip the sickly
ties that earthly man has made
and now every mother,
can choose the color
of her child
that's not natures way
Well that's what they
said yesterday
there's nothing left to
do but pray
I think it's time I found a
new religion
Waoh it's so insane
to synthesize another strain
there's something in
these future
that we have to be told
Futures made of virtual insanity
now always seem to
be govern'd by this love we have
for useless,twisting,
our new technology
oh, now there is no sound
for we all live underground
Now there is no sound
If we all live underground
and now it's virtual insanity
forget your virtual reality
oh,there's nothing so bad,
I know yeah
Futures made of virtual insanity
now always seem to,
be govern'd by this love we have
for useless,twisting,
our new technology
oh now there is no sound
for we all live underground
Livin- Virtual insanity
Livin- Virtual insanity
Livin- Virtual insanity
Livin- Virtual insanity
Virtual insanity is
what we're livin' in
